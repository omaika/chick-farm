# Changelog

## Unreleased

- opencode 1.x (tested with 1.18.34), from sting8k/piggery v0.8.0: an opencode session you open
  joins piggery through a plugin, and a team can start opencode workers (`opencode serve`, one per
  worker). Mail wakes an idle session and reaches a busy one at its next step; `abort`, `stop`,
  `resume` and `model` work on its workers. `setup opencode` adds one `plugin` entry to your
  `opencode.json` and refuses an `opencode.jsonc` (it prints the line to add by hand). Workers keep
  your opencode setup, except the `question` and `task` tools (`disabled_tools` in
  `harness/opencode.json`; a role gets one back with `spawn.allow_tools`). Run `piggery restart`,
  then `piggery setup opencode`.
- Template `amp-like`, after [Amp](https://ampcode.com)'s oracle and code review: a lead does the
  work and calls an oracle (hard reasoning) or a reviewer (one diff), each answering once. It pays
  off when they run another model family than the lead.
- Template `gastown-like`, after [Gas Town](https://github.com/gastownhall/gastown): a mayor splits
  the work, polecats do each task on their own branch and worktree, and a refinery merges the
  branches one at a time into an integration branch. Your own branch moves only when you say.
- `council`: the chair stops at the verdict and starts agents for other work, such as carrying out
  the decision, only when you ask.
- [manifests/README.md](manifests/README.md) draws every built-in template, with when to pick it,
  and `AGENTS.md` gives the rules that keep the design intact, for people and coding agents.
- `setup <harness>` keeps one copy of each of your config files it is about to change for the first
  time, in `~/.piggery/backups/setup/<harness>/`. `setup remove` still takes out only piggery's part
  and never restores the copy.
- Fix: `setup pi --ext` then `setup remove pi` left a `settings.json` of `{}` where there was none,
  and could re-indent other values in it (such as `packages`).
- Fix: mail that reached a pi session at the very end of a reply was shown to the model, and pi
  went on working with it, but piggery took the turn as finished; mail sent after that waited,
  unannounced. The turn now stays open while pi works on that mail. The pi and omp integrations
  are now 6 and dsh 7: run `piggery setup --outdated`, then restart open pi sessions or `/reload`
  them. From sting8k/piggery v0.9.1.
- Fix: a stopped worker no longer leaves an empty directory under `~/.piggery/run/`.
- Fix: Codex Desktop, and TUIs started with `--remote`, run every thread in one `codex app-server`,
  so piggery made them one participant and a wake could reach the wrong thread. Under a shared
  app-server each thread is now its own participant (its host names the thread's session id); a
  tool call there without a session id is refused. From sting8k/piggery v0.7.1.
- `supervisor-executor`: the supervisor may pin (`can_pin: true`) and its prompt says to keep on
  the board what no task holds (the goal, decisions and why, approaches dropped), replacing the pin
  as they change, and to read the board first when it comes back without the team's history. An
  installed `manifest.yaml` you edited (Settings edits it too) is not updated: set the supervisor's
  `can_pin: true` yourself, or it is refused when it pins.
- Filter the list by status: `ps --status working,waiting` (`working`, `idle`, `waiting`, `gone`);
  in `top`, `f` lists only one status in turn (working, waiting, idle, gone, then every row; kept
  for the next `top`); in `web`, a click on a count in the header (working, idle, waiting) lists only
  that status, several at once, `f` clears it (kept in the browser). A team keeps its line while a
  member matches.
- A `thinking` column after `model` in `top`, `ps` and `web`: a member's thinking level as its
  session reports it, else as it was spawned or last set (`-` when unknown, e.g. inherit). A
  `display.columns` you wrote lists it only once you add it.
- `web` has Settings (`s`, or ⚙ in the header): the model and thinking workers start with, per
  harness profile (`~/.piggery/harness/<h>.json`) and per template role (`spawn.harness`,
  `spawn.model`, `spawn.thinking` in `~/.piggery/templates/<t>/manifest.yaml`), and each template's
  `limits` (`depth`, `concurrency`: live workers at once per team, the message and respawn rates).
  A save writes that
  value in place and keeps the rest of the file (comments, order, layout); a template's change is
  checked as `team up` loads it (a role that can spawn with `concurrency: none` is refused), and its warnings (a model pinned with harness
  `inherit`) are shown. Nothing restarts: teams founded from then on use it, a team already up
  keeps its own.

## v0.8.1 - 2026-10-05

After upgrading, run `piggery setup --outdated`: the pi and omp integrations are now 5 and dsh 6
(the `agent` tool has the `merge` action; `send` has `op: accept|drop`).

- `send` with `op: accept` or `op: drop` and `reply_to` a mail of the member's task (its handback,
  usually), from its `reports_to`, closes that task: `top` shows it accepted or dropped,
  `idle_with_task_for` stops waiting on it, an accept or drop wants no answer for `unanswered_for`,
  and the events `task_accepted`/`task_dropped` let `piggery log` count them. The supervisor and
  slp prompts close each task this way.
- Timers have more conditions than `silent_for`, one per rule: `idle_with_task_for` (a member idle
  while its task waits on it), `unanswered_for` (a teammate's mail left without anything back) and
  `max_rework` (more `rework` mails than that on one task). `notify: self` reminds the member
  itself, and `escalate_to` (a role, `reports_to`, `self` or `notify`, the Human) is told once when
  the incident still holds `escalate_after` later (default: the condition's duration; `max_rework`:
  at the next rework). An escalation to `notify` is a notice of kind `watch`. The built-in
  templates use them.
- Timers: `piggery watch rm <id>` stops one of yours. A timer whose target left its team is
  turned off instead of firing into a mailbox nobody reads, and a repeating one skips a target
  that is gone (stopped) until it is back; a one-off still fires. Each turn-off is a `timer_off`
  event. `piggery skills` and the Lead's prompt say how to use timers, and that they are not for
  polling.
- `piggery tasks` and a Tasks tab (`a`) in `web` list the tasks given in a team, or in every team
  of a project directory (a directory's line in `web` is selectable for it), newest first, with
  what became of each: open, handed back, accepted, dropped, or replaced by a next task before
  anyone closed it, and the reworks it took. A task accepted without ever being handed back says
  so.
- `web` has a Board tab (`b`): the live pins of the selected row's team, whole, oldest first, so
  a lane's plan is read where the Overview only lists its first line. `piggery mail --team T
  --pins` prints the same.
- A board pin is replaced or removed only by its author, a member above the author in the
  `reports_to` chain, or the team's gate (`board.not_yours` otherwise); a pin whose author is gone
  is anyone's who can pin. One Lead can no longer overwrite another lane's plan, nor a `p2p` peer
  another's pin. The `slp` supervisor removes a lane's pins once the lane is merged or dropped.
- Timer condition `max_rework_across: N`: more than N `rework` mails sent by a member over two
  or more tasks, so reworks spread thin (two here, one there) that no task's `max_rework` counts
  still reach someone, as a question whether they share one cause. Told once per member, escalated
  at the next rework. `slp` watches its Leads with it, `supervisor-executor` its supervisor.
  The DB moves to schema v23 for it (an index on rework mails; the old DB is backed up first).
- The built-in role prompts guard against more agent-team anti-patterns: an executor or Peer names
  a missing mechanism instead of building a stand-in, changes the thing rather than wrapping it,
  checks before giving in to a doubt, and does not reshape the product to make a check pass; a
  supervisor or Lead gives outcomes rather than implementation steps, says where the undone part
  of an accepted handback goes, and fixes a shared cause instead of its symptoms.
- `found` without a template founds `supervisor-executor`, not `p2p`.
- Templates have `when_to_use` and `when_not_to_use` lines; `agent action=templates` lists them so
  an agent picks a template by criteria, not by its summary alone. The built-ins have them.
- `piggery team migrate <team> <template> [--map old=new]` moves an open team to another template,
  keeping its members, mail, board and workers; each live member gets its new role card by mail.
- `agent action=merge` (`piggery agent merge`) records a merge: `merged`, `conflict`, `resolved`
  or `aborted`, with the branch, what it went into and a note. Each is an event; `ps`/`top` show a
  team's merges in its Overview, and a team with an open conflict is flagged until it is recorded
  resolved or aborted. The `slp` prompts ask the Lead and the Supervisor to record theirs.
- `top` and `web` list a team's live board pins in its Overview (`#N`, first line, who pinned it,
  when, and how many lines), so the Human sees a lane's plan; `ps --json` has them as `pins`.
- `piggery mail`: a team's or a participant's messages, newest first, with kind and state; it acks
  nothing. `log --team` takes a team's name too.
- Eleven skills for templates' roles, in `manifests/skills/`, adapted from seatworks: `test-first`,
  `diagnosing-bugs`, `security-check`, `test-proof-debt-audit` for workers; `planning-lanes`,
  `council`, `repo-refresh` for a Lead; `grilling`, `pre-mortem`, `architecture-premise-audit`,
  `retrospective` for a supervisor. They use piggery's mail and board, and keep the team's records at
  the repository's root (`CONTEXT.md`, `NOTEBOOK.md`, `notes/`). They are unpacked into
  `~/.piggery/skills/` like the templates (an edited file is kept), and `supervisor-executor` and
  `slp` list them for their roles.
- `roles.<r>.skills` in a template: piggery's skills the role uses (`inherit`, the default, and
  `[]`: none). The role's card names each with when to use it and the `SKILL.md` to read, found in
  the template's `skills/` or in `~/.piggery/skills/`; nothing is loaded into the harness, so it
  works the same in every harness and in the session you opened, and costs a line per skill until
  one is read. The harness's own skills are left as they are. `top` shows them in the Overview,
  and the templates list names them.
- `spawn.refused_commands` in `config.yaml` (default `[paseo]`): commands a worker's shell must not
  start. Each is a failing command first on every worker's `PATH` (`~/.piggery/bin`), and a Claude
  worker's settings deny it too. `paseo` is refused because it starts agents outside piggery's
  limits, routing and view. `[]` turns it off.
- `piggery web` shows `top` in the browser at http://127.0.0.1:4125 (loopback only): the same
  rows, tabs, Overview, Tail, events and notices, live, with kill and the model picker, and a Mail
  tab: a participant's or a team's messages and where each stands. Reading acks nothing.
- A Claude or Codex session whose locale writes dates in another language (e.g. `LANG=pt_BR.UTF-8`)
  is found again: piggery reads `ps` in the C locale. Before, its MCP server listed no tools and its
  hooks did nothing.
- Windows: pi and omp workers start without Developer Mode. A worker's agent dir links to your
  own entries with symlinks, which Windows only allows with Developer Mode on or elevated; without
  that, a folder is now linked as a junction and a file as a hard link.

## v0.8.0 - 2026-10-03

piggery runs on Windows (amd64 and arm64): `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sting8k/piggery/main/install.ps1 | iex`.

After upgrading, run `piggery setup --outdated`: the pi and omp integrations are now 4 and dsh 5
(they find the daemon's named pipe on Windows; nothing changes on macOS and Linux).

- On Windows the daemon listens on a named pipe (`\\.\pipe\piggery-<hash of ~/.piggery>`, this
  user only) instead of `~/.piggery/piggery.sock`; peer checks, the singleton lock and the process
  table use the Windows APIs instead of `ps` and `flock`.
- Windows has no SIGTERM: stopping a worker closes its stdin, waits, then ends its whole process
  tree.
- Notify hooks on Windows are the `.exe`, `.com`, `.cmd`, `.bat` and `.ps1` files of
  `hooks/notify.d/`; `setup notify add` (sh scripts) is not available there.
- `piggery update` on Windows moves the running `piggery.exe` aside to `piggery.exe.old` and removes
  it on a later update.
- Releases carry `piggery-windows-amd64.exe` and `piggery-windows-arm64.exe`.

## v0.7.0 - 2026-10-03

piggery now tells you, by itself, when a team's mail flow needs you, and `piggery check` tests your
files before a restart.

After upgrading, run `piggery setup --outdated`: the pi and omp integrations are now 3 and dsh 4
(Paseo, Claude and Codex are unchanged). Then restart the pi, omp and dsh sessions that were open.

Breaking: only piggery writes to `notify` now. An agent's send to `notify` is refused, and a
`to: notify` routing line or a `notify: notify` timer in a template is ignored with a warning
(`piggery check` lists them). Notify hooks run from `~/.piggery/hooks/notify.d/`; a single
`~/.piggery/hooks/notify` is no longer run, so move it into that directory.

- Notices, decided by the engine at the end of a gate's turn, from the team's mail alone: `reply`
  (a turn on team mail ended and the gate sent nothing), `settled` (the gate sent its last message
  and nobody works or has mail waiting), `failed` (a turn on team mail failed, so that mail waits)
  and `gate_lost`. Your chat with the gate, a gate that is still dispatching work, a headless gate
  and a member that is not the gate never notify. The hook's JSON line adds `gate` and `dir`,
  and `kind` is the notice's kind. The respawn-limit notice goes to the worker's lead only.
- `piggery setup notify add desktop|herdr|ntfy:<topic>` writes a ready hook into `notify.d/`
  (`remove` takes it out; alone, it lists the hooks and what each needs). Every file there runs in
  parallel, each with its own 10-second limit.
- `piggery check`: reads `config.yaml`, the harness profiles, every template and your prompts with
  the daemon's own loaders and prints what they would refuse or ignore; it changes nothing.
- The daemon checks once a day for a newer release; `top`, `setup` and `update --check` say `vX
  available: piggery update`. Nothing is installed on its own; `update.check: false` turns it off.
- `top` shows the latest notices at the bottom left, beside the events; `n` opens or closes them,
  like `e` for the events. `ps --view` carries them as `notices`, and the update notice as
  `daemon.update`.
- The template list an agent reads now also shows a template that `team up` would refuse.
- Fix: a build stamped `dev-<sha>` is treated as a build from source: `piggery update` no longer
  replaces it with an older release unless `--force`.

## v0.6.0 - 2026-10-01

The Paseo plugin is rebuilt on what `piggery top` shows, and a project no longer jumps around the
list when its sessions reconnect.

After upgrading, run `piggery setup --outdated`: the pi and omp integrations are now 2, dsh 3 and
Paseo 3. Then restart the pi, omp and dsh sessions that were open, and reload the Paseo app.

- Paseo plugin, rebuilt: the Overview has `top`'s rows, order, state words, folds and since, one
  line per worker with a ctx column, a header with working/idle/waiting counts, events as short
  lines, and a dialog with a worker's details and tail. A new Board tab gives one band per project
  and a column per status (working, idle, waiting, gone), filtered by team; projects with nothing
  live start folded, and gone workers show on request.
- `piggery ps --view` and `piggery tail --view` print what `top` shows as versioned JSON (rows with
  their actions, header counts, events, Overview; tail lines with their kind). The Paseo plugin reads
  them from the installed binary, so `top`, `ps` and the plugin always agree.
- Projects are listed live first, then sleeping (nothing working and no real turn for over a day),
  all gone, closed. A live project sorts by its latest real turn; a reconnect or a daemon restart
  moves nothing.
- An idle worker's or solo's since counts from its last real turn, not from a reconnect. `ps --json`
  gives a solo's `last_turn_end` too.
- `piggery top`: in a live headless worker's Overview, a click on the model (blue, `▾`) or `M` opens a
  picker of the models its harness offers, with the thinking level; `enter` or a double-click
  applies (a dsh worker lists its models once the dsh integration is updated). The footer always
  lists `M model`, dim where it does nothing.
- Fix: in pi, omp and dsh sessions, a wake or reconnect that finds no mail is not a turn any more (no
  empty turn, last turn kept); needs the updated integration.
- Fix: in `top`'s Overview, the last turn no longer runs into the joined/spawned value.

## v0.5.3 - 2026-09-30

Big teams stay readable in `piggery top`, and a worker's piggery tool call survives a daemon restart.

After upgrading, reload the Paseo app if you use its plugin (its integration is now 2; `piggery setup
--outdated` updates it).

- `piggery top`: Enter opens or closes everywhere: a team (live ones too), the gone line, a member's
  details; `t` only switches Overview/Tail. A collapsed team is one line with its working/idle/gone
  counts and held mail, and top remembers which teams you opened or closed (`<dir>/cache/top.json`).
- Gone members with no live worker under them fold into one dim row at the bottom of their team
  (`▸ N members  ✗ gone  <since>`, on the columns), in `top`, `piggery ps` and the Paseo plugin;
  Enter expands it. A team's members are indented under the team's title, and the list no longer
  has an unacked column (the header, details and a folded team still show it).
- `piggery top` and the Paseo plugin: all-gone and closed teams are rows on the columns
  (`▸ team old  ✗ gone  15h`), a solo row has a team row's shape, and the state column keeps one
  width whatever the states, so the layout depends only on the window.
- `piggery top` and the Paseo plugin: the gate is tagged on its member (`summer-hamster (gate)`)
  instead of on the team line; a requested worker shows as `◌ queued` (ps keeps `requested`); the
  cwd column shows only when someone works outside their group's directory.
- `piggery top` scrolls a long list under a column header that stays put, with `↑ N` / `↓ N` on the
  border for rows out of view; PgUp/PgDn and Home/End (`? all keys`). Opening, closing or scrolling
  never moves a column, and a collapsed team line drops whole parts to fit instead of being cut.
- `piggery top`: the footer says whether the mouse is captured (`m mouse on` / `m mouse off`), and
  events show their time (`14:12:05` today, `09-29 14:12` before) instead of how long ago. Events
  start folded; `e` opens them and top remembers it.
- Paseo plugin, like top: Events fold (folded by default), event times, a folded team shows its
  counts, and folds are remembered on the Paseo host.
- `prompts` in config.yaml takes `*` (every role, every template, and solo sessions) and
  `<template>/*` (every role of that template); a file several entries name is added once.
- `team up` warns when a role pins `spawn.model` or `spawn.thinking` but leaves `harness: inherit`:
  a model name belongs to one harness.
- Fix: a Claude Code or Codex worker's piggery tool call made while the daemon restarts waits up to
  10 seconds for the connection and then runs, instead of failing. A call already sent when the
  connection dropped still fails, so nothing runs twice.
- Fix: a tool call right after the first connect could fail with "piggery is not reachable right
  now".
- Fix: `piggery x <name>` (and abort, model, resume, tail) no longer refuses a name when the other
  matches are gone members of closed teams; the live participant wins.

## v0.5.2 - 2026-09-30

Fix: `x` and `kill` now stop the command a worker is running, not only the worker.

- `x` / `kill` left a worker's running shell command alive when the harness ran it in a process group of
  its own (pi's bash tool does). Kill now asks first (SIGTERM, so the harness and its extensions clean
  up), waits up to 2 seconds, then SIGKILLs the worker and everything left in its process tree; stop
  ends the tree the same way. Something detached before the kill that no tool tracks may survive.

## v0.5.1 - 2026-09-30

An emergency stop in `piggery top` (`x` kills the selected worker) and a tidier bottom of the screen.

- Emergency stop: `x` in `piggery top` kills the selected headless worker (it asks `kill <name>? y/n`
  once; a session you opened gets a reason and nothing else), and `piggery x <worker>` is the short
  form of `piggery kill`.
- `piggery top`: events in a box that `e` folds to one line (`● Events · <latest>`; it starts folded
  under 30 rows), and the keys on two aligned lines under a rule.

## v0.5.0 - 2026-09-30

`piggery setup --outdated` brings what piggery installed for your harnesses up to date, and user docs
are public: `docs/guide.md` and `docs/reference.md`.

After upgrading, run `piggery setup --outdated`; reload the Paseo app if you use its plugin. Each
thing piggery installs for a harness now has an integration version, and whether it is outdated is
decided by that number, not by the build.

- One integer for each of pi, omp, dsh, claude, codex and paseo, bumped only when what is installed
  changes; an install carries it as `PIGGERY_INTEGRATION_VERSION=N`. A rebuild that leaves the
  installed part as it was no longer reads as outdated or rewrites anything. Installs from before
  this read as outdated once. pi, omp and dsh are brought up by the daemon at its start; for claude,
  codex and paseo the daemon logs one warning, `ps` and `top` show `outdated: claude (v1 < v2):
  piggery setup --outdated` (`ps --json` has the list as `outdated`, which the Paseo plugin reads
  instead of running a command), and `setup` and `doctor` show `vN < vM` (a Codex hook missing from
  `hooks.json` counts).
- `piggery setup --outdated` updates every installed integration that is outdated (`setup <harness>`
  for each, one line per update and what to do after); not installed ones are untouched, and it says
  so when all is current. `install.sh` no longer runs anything after an install: it prints
  `piggery setup <harness>` for a new machine and `piggery setup --outdated` for an upgrade.
- Docs: `docs/guide.md` (by task, including how to customize `~/.piggery`) and `docs/reference.md`
  (every command, every key of `config.yaml`, the harness profiles and the template manifest, and
  what each harness can do), linked from the README. The adapters' "piggery binary is not on PATH"
  error links the guide.
- `top` shows the daemon's version at the end of its key footer; when the `piggery` you run is
  another build, it is amber with `(cli <version>: piggery restart)`. `ps --json` has `version`.
- Paseo plugin: a session you opened has a Tail and ctx/turns (from its transcript), a member's
  Overview shows its current task (handed back, newer mail), and the list starts with top's status
  line: daemon age, teams, working and idle, held, unacked, version, and the outdated notice.

## v0.4.0 - 2026-09-29

Shared prompts: your own rules (code style, how you organise a project) go into the role card of
the roles you pick, in every template and harness.

- `config.yaml` `prompts: [{file, roles}]`: a role is `<role>` (every template), `<template>/<role>`
  or `solo`. The file is read each time a card is built, so an edit reaches the next session with no
  restart. A mistake (an unreadable file, an unknown template, a role in no template) is a warning
  in `~/.piggery/serve.log` and that part is skipped; it never stops the daemon or a spawn.
- A template's name key is `template:` (was `model:`, easy to read as the AI model). Your templates
  are rewritten in place at `setup` or daemon start (only that key); teams already made keep
  working, and a file with `model:` is still read.
- Mail headers name the sender's real role and the relation: `ana (supervisor, you report to
  them)`, `bo (executor, reports to you)`; before, any superior read "your lead" and a same-role
  member "your peer". Codex workers are told to ask the member they report to, not "your lead".

## v0.3.0 - 2026-09-29

Two new harnesses, omp (oh-my-pi) and dsh (DeepSeek Harness 0.2), and each member's current task
in `piggery top`.

Breaking: mail threads, `expects_reply` and the limits `max_hops` and `messages_per_thread` are
removed, and a team template that sets either limit to a number is refused; delete the key. Nothing
in piggery acted on them: `reply_to` stays, and `messages_per_participant_per_minute` is the flood
guard. Mail held by a removed limit is released when the daemon upgrades its database. Teams
already up keep working. Run `piggery setup pi` again so pi sessions stop showing `thread=`.

- omp: `piggery setup omp` adds piggery to omp sessions (mail is steered in and shows in the
  session); a role can run omp workers (`harness: omp`), resumed with their context after a stop.
- dsh 0.2.0-rc.1: `piggery setup dsh` adds piggery to `dsh web` sessions; a role can run dsh
  workers (`harness: dsh`). Workers turn off dsh's upload of session logs to DeepSeek.
- `send --op assign` marks a mail as the member's current task (a spawn or resume task is one);
  `top`'s Overview shows it, whether it was handed back, and a newer unmarked mail.
- `reply_to` takes a bare `N` as well as `#N`.
- The daemon backs up its database before a schema upgrade (`~/.piggery/backups/`, the 3 newest
  kept).
- `~/.piggery` is laid out as `plugins/`, `run/` (per-run scratch), `sessions/` (session data
  piggery keeps); gc removes a removed participant's entries there and in `logs/`, and now also
  removes a solo session gone longer than `gc.closed_after` (archived first, like a closed team).
- `send` answers `sent #N`; a mail's header has no `thread=`; `send --expects-reply` is gone.
- `top`: an open team whose members are all gone is one line; a model switched by `piggery model`
  shows at once. The Paseo plugin starts such a team collapsed (every Paseo app needs 0.9.1+).
- The built-in templates allow 10 live workers at once (`limits.concurrency`, was 4 or 5).
- An installed built-in template file you edited to exactly the new built-in is updated again by
  later versions.
- The gate roles' prompts and the solo card point to `piggery skills` for the rest of piggery.
- One-line install for Linux and macOS:
  `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sting8k/piggery/main/install.sh | sh` picks the
  build for your OS and CPU, checks it against the release's `checksums.txt`, and installs it in
  `~/.local/bin` (`PIGGERY_INSTALL_DIR`, `PIGGERY_VERSION` to change).
- A release's notes on GitHub are its section of this changelog.
- Tests that wait for the daemon to start allow 10 seconds, so a slow CI runner no longer fails them.

## v0.2.0 - 2026-09-29

Breaking: a team template with a `tools:` section is now refused. Give its roles `send` and say in
their prompt what to send to whom, then delete the section. An installed built-in template you
edited is not updated for you; edit it the same way.

- Every role of the built-in templates talks with `send` (no `done`/`ask`/`answer` tools).
- Declarative tools are removed: a template with a `tools:` section is refused; use `send`.
- A new session's default name is one word.
- Interactive sessions (pi, Claude, Codex; solos too) show ctx, turns and a tail in `top`, `ps --json` and `piggery tail`, read from the harness's own transcript.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-09-28

First release.

- One Go binary with a local daemon (SQLite, unix socket). Nothing runs in the cloud.
- Mail that waits for an agent to be back, and counts as delivered only when the agent's turn
  that read it has finished.
- Team layouts as YAML: roles, who may talk to whom, who may spawn whom. The daemon checks every
  send and spawn. Built-in: `supervisor-executor`, `slp`, `council`, `p2p`; make your own with
  `piggery template new`.
- Harnesses: pi, Claude Code and Codex (`piggery setup`). Headless workers run in their own
  sessions and can be stopped, resumed and switched to another model.
- Watch and step in: `top`, `ps`, `log`, `tail`, `why`, `abort`, `kill`, `resume`, `model`,
  `release`.
- Paseo plugin: `piggery setup paseo` adds a Piggery view (the same as `piggery top`) to Paseo.
- Upkeep: `gc` archives closed teams, `doctor` checks the daemon's state, `update` installs a
  newer release.
